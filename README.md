# Krita MCP Server

Let AI paint in [Krita](https://krita.org/) via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

This bridge allows Claude (or any MCP client) to create canvases, paint strokes, draw shapes, export images, and more — all inside a running Krita instance.

## How It Works

Two components:

1. **Krita Plugin** (`krita-plugin/`) — A Python plugin that runs inside Krita, exposing an HTTP server on `localhost:5678`. It receives paint commands and executes them on Krita's main thread via a command queue.

2. **MCP Server** (`server.py`) — A [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) server that exposes painting tools to any MCP client. It translates MCP tool calls into HTTP requests to the Krita plugin.

```
MCP Client (Claude, etc.)  ←→  MCP Server (server.py)  ←→  Krita Plugin (HTTP on :5678)  ←→  Krita
```

## Setup

### 1. Install the Krita Plugin

Copy the plugin files to your Krita plugins directory:

| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\krita\pykrita\` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/krita/pykrita/` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/krita/pykrita/` |

**These are the defaults — they do not depend on where Krita itself is installed, but they are
not guaranteed either.** Krita keeps its resource location (where `pykrita/`, brush presets, etc.
live) in its own config, separately from the install path, and that location can differ from the
table above if you've set a custom resource folder (Settings → Manage Resources → *Open Resources
Folder*) or are running a portable build. If the plugin doesn't show up after following the steps
below, open that dialog first and copy the plugin files into the `pykrita/` folder it actually
shows you, not the table above.

Copy both:
- `krita-plugin/kritamcp/` (the folder with `__init__.py`)
- `krita-plugin/kritamcp.desktop`

Then in Krita: **Settings → Configure Krita → Python Plugin Manager → Enable "Krita MCP Bridge"** and restart Krita.

**Troubleshooting: plugin doesn't appear in the Python Plugin Manager list at all.** This means
Krita never found the files — the HTTP bridge then never starts, so an MCP client can reach
`server.py` (the stdio process) just fine while every tool call fails with "Cannot connect to
Krita," which can look like a networking problem but isn't one. In order of likelihood:
1. **Wrong resource folder** (see above) — the most common cause for portable/custom installs.
   Verify via Settings → Manage Resources → *Open Resources Folder* and re-copy the files there.
2. Both `kritamcp/` (the folder) and `kritamcp.desktop` (the file) need to be copied — a `.desktop`
   file with no matching folder, or vice versa, won't register.
3. Krita's Python scripting support itself needs to be available to have a Python Plugin Manager
   at all — check Settings → Configure Krita → Python Plugin Manager exists and lists *any*
   plugins (including Krita's own bundled ones) before troubleshooting further.
4. A restart is required after enabling the plugin — Krita does not hot-reload plugin changes or
   newly-enabled plugins into the current session.

### 2. Install the MCP Server

```bash
pip install fastmcp httpx
```

Or with a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Your MCP Client

Add to your MCP client config (e.g., Claude Desktop's `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "krita": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

If using a virtual environment:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "krita": {
      "command": "/path/to/.venv/Scripts/python",
      "args": ["/path/to/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description |

| `krita_new_canvas` | Create a new canvas (width, height, background color) |
| `krita_set_color` | Set foreground paint color (hex) |
| `krita_set_brush` | Set brush preset, size, and opacity |
| `krita_stroke` | Paint a stroke through a list of [x, y] points |
| `krita_fill` | Fill a circular area at a point |
| `krita_draw_shape` | Draw rectangle, ellipse, or line |
| `krita_get_canvas` | Export canvas to PNG (for AI to see progress) |
| `krita_save` | Save canvas to a specific file path |
| `krita_undo` / `krita_redo` | Undo/redo actions |
| `krita_clear` | Clear canvas to a solid color |
| `krita_get_color_at` | Eyedropper — sample color at a pixel |
| `krita_list_brushes` | List available brush presets |
| `krita_open_file` | Open an existing .kra, .png, .jpg, etc. |

## The Export Timeout Fix

**This is the main reason this repo exists.**

By default, HTTP requests and command queue operations time out after ~30 seconds. Canvas export (`get_canvas`) and file save (`save`) operations can easily exceed this on larger canvases, causing silent failures or timeout errors.

The fix is applied in two places:

**MCP Server (`server.py`)** — Extended timeout for export/save commands:
```python
# In krita_get_canvas and krita_save:
result = send_command("get_canvas", {"filename": filename}, timeout=120.0)
result = send_command("save", {"path": path}, timeout=120.0)
```

**Krita Plugin (`__init__.py`)** — Matching timeout in the command queue:
```python
def get_result(self, command_id, timeout=120):
    """Wait for result with timeout."""
    for _ in range(int(timeout * 10)):  # Check every 100ms
        ...
```

**Both sides must match.** If only the MCP server timeout is increased, the plugin's command queue will still time out at 30s. If only the plugin timeout is increased, the HTTP request from the MCP server will time out first.

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | How to Change |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Plugin HTTP port | `5678` | Edit `SERVER_PORT` in plugin `__init__.py` |
| MCP server URL | `http://localhost:5678` | Set `KRITA_URL` env var |
| Canvas output dir | `~/krita-mcp-output` | Edit `CANVAS_OUTPUT_DIR` in plugin `__init__.py` |

## Painting Approach

The plugin paints using **direct pixel manipulation** (not Krita's native brush engine for strokes). This means:

- Strokes use a custom soft-circle renderer with configurable hardness
- Alpha blending is done manually in BGRA pixel format
- Shapes (rectangle, ellipse, line) are rasterized directly
- This approach is reliable and doesn't depend on Krita's internal brush state

The `set_brush` tool does set Krita's brush preset (for potential future use), but `stroke` currently uses its own pixel-level rendering.
